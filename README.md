# General Info

This simple decoder was created to decode Skudonet WAF syslog on Wazuh since there is no official decoder that provided by Wazuh.

This project inspired by ModSecurity WAF Log decoder since it has similar pattern log to Skudonet WAF Ruleset Log

# Requirement

To ensure Skudonet WAF Log well decoded, please make sure you enable:
- Wazuh archive log
- Rsyslog on Skudonet WAF Machine and Wazuh Server

# Expected output

Here you can see sample log and how the output
